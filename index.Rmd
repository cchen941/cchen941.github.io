# WHERE DO I COME FROM?


My hometown is Anhui, China. I lived in many cities in China before coming to the United States. There is Chengdu, a city famous for its gourmet food; Beijing, the capital; and Shanghai, one of the most modern cities in China. I studied at Sichuan University in China and the University of Pittsburgh in the United States for my bachelor's degree. I like Pittsburgh very much, my life there was very comfortable and chill. Now I live in Los Angeles. I enjoy the bustling feeling and colorful life in Los Angeles. I also like the weather in California better than the eastern US.



# WHAT I DID?


My undergraduate major is Industrial Engineering with a minor in Economics. At USC, I switched from a program in Operations Research to Analytics. During my undergraduate school, I completed many IE-related projects, related filed including operation research, supply chain, facility layout, data analysis, etc. After graduation from undergraduate degree, I did an internship in ByteDance, China for several months, and I was engaged in personnel-related work. Now at usc, I am working hard to complete more projects related to health care systems and data analysis. My ongoing project is to cooperate with LAC Healthcare network to help them create an optimal weekly shift schedule for OR nurses at hospital with some tools of data analysis. 

# WHAT I AM GOING TO DO? 

I would like to dedicate my career life to industries related to healthcare systems. Healthcare is a big part of everybodyâ€™s life and will become more so. I plan to use my skills to make healthcare operations better in the future.
